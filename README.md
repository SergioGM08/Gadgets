Simple tools for everyday life. Feel free to download them.

* [Hydroclock:](https://github.com/SergioGM08/Gadgets/tree/main/Hydroclock) Set reminders for those who forget to drink water. Customize the time interval and set start and end times. Pause whenever you like. Compatible with Windows 10 and 11.  
  **Note:** Once you've set a reminder, don't close the app. Notifications might not display correctly if you're watching a full-screen video.
* Passgen: (IN PROGRESS) This application is designed to securely create and store passwords directly on your device. Passwords are saved in an encrypted format within a CSV file to ensure their protection. Using a single master password, you can decrypt and access any of the stored passwords when needed. The encryption process keeps your sensitive information safe, while the master password serves as the key to unlock your stored credentials. This ensures that even if someone accesses the CSV file, they cannot retrieve the passwords without the master password.
